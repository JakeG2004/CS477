What's needed though is more practice assignments or labs for applying what's discussed in the course python notebooks (though it's still pretty early in the course so maybe some of those are planned).

So far when delving in the machine learning concepts in class, I'm personally still digesting the content then there is no textbook to clarify what was meant (it feels fragmented in class) and there hasn't been a way to expand what was said or reinforce my understanding with what was taught in class/that week. Are there any known online sources that gamify machine learning code concepts? Any reading recommendations or workbook questions if the student needs more practice?

I think there should be small bite-sized assignments that have specific focus but useful. Then some popular machine learning problems that say a lot. The notebooks have been nice but still feels fragmented and I've been having a hard time reading what is typed on the board (too small). 

Though so far the Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. Müller and Sarah Guido (very accessible with free PDFs online) has been helpful. But maybe there are other reading resources that are well-known (websites/textbook) more closely related to this class. A previous course I took about computer network security with Dr. Kolias would not only explain in class but post associated reading snippet for what's being talked about that day/week -- this was nice.",20.0
